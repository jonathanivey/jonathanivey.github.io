I am first year PhD Student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University co-advised by [Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/) and [Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degrees in data science and mathematics at the University of Arkansas where I was advised by [Dr. Susan Gauch](https://engineering.uark.edu/electrical-engineering-computer-science/computer-science-faculty/uid/sgauch/name/Susan+E.+Gauch/) and collaborated with [Dr. David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.

My research interests are currently focused on capturing nuance in text. I am particularly interested in NLP methods for collecting and analyzing qualitative data at scale. Previously, I have done research on retaining disagreement in human annotations, evaluating the ability of LLMs to simulate human dialogues, and helping stress detection models generalize to minorities.

In general, I love projects that try to model complicated, context-dependent data, and I am always looking for creative visualizations. Outside of work, I play guitar and enjoy watching movies. If you have any questions or just want to chat, please reach out!
